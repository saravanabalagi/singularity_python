# Singularity Python

This repo contains singularity container definition files for py38 with CUDA/CuDNN support built on top of [nvidia/cuda](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda). Clone and modify existing files to get different versions of python. To exclude CUDA/CuDNN support, use Ubuntu base images, e.g. `ubuntu:focal`.

Provides useful base containers for [Dev](https://github.com/saravanabalagi/singularity_dev) and [Pytorch](https://github.com/saravanabalagi/singularity_pytorch)
